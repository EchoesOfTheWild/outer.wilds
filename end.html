<h1>The way Outer Wilds reveals its secrets feels magical.
     There’s always a sense of discovery,
      of stumbling upon something incredible you hadn’t noticed before.
       The interconnectedness of the game’s mysteries and the feeling of progress through knowledge
        (not power) gives a sense of accomplishment that is truly rewarding.</h1>
